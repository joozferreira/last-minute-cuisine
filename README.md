Project: Recipe Recommender

_Description_
Create a web application that recommends recipes based on user input for ingredients they have on hand. The application should allow users to input the ingredients they have available, and then suggest recipes that can be made using those ingredients.

_Main Features_

User Input Interface:

- Provide an input field where users can enter ingredients they have.
- Allow users to add multiple ingredients.
- Implement a button to submit the list of ingredients.

_Recipe Database_

- Create a database or utilize an external API that contains a collection of recipes along with their ingredients and instructions.
- Each recipe should be represented as an object with properties for the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.

_Matching Algorithm_

- Write a function that takes the user's input of ingredients and matches it with recipes from the database.
- Use if-else structures and loops to compare the user's input with the ingredients of each recipe.
- Determine a matching score for each recipe based on the number of shared ingredients.

_Display Results_

- Display the matched recipes to the user, sorted by matching score (highest to lowest).
- Include the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions for each matched recipe.
- If no matching recipes are found, provide a message indicating that no recipes are available with the given ingredients.

_Additional Features (Optional)_

- Allow users to filter results by cuisine, meal type, or dietary restrictions.
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for displaying long lists of recipes.
- Include images of the recipes to make the interface more visually appealing.
- Add a feature to save favorite recipes for later reference.

_Skills Tested_

- Input field handling for gathering user input.
- Working with objects to represent recipes and their attributes.
- Utilizing arrays to store lists of ingredients and recipes.
- Implementing if-else structures to control program flow based on conditions.
- Using loops to iterate over arrays and objects to perform tasks such as matching ingredients and displaying results.
